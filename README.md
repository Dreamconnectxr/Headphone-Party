# Headphone-Party
HeadphoneParty is a web app that lets anyone host a legal, local headphone party over Wi-Fi. The host streams music via OBS to a local server, and guests join by scanning a QR code. The app synchronizes playback across devices using BPM detection or manual tap-to-sync, so everyone can dance to the same beat.
